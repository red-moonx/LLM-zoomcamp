### 🌟 [Play with the Live App Here! (Click Me)](https://athletica-agentic-rag.streamlit.app) 🌟

Athletica is an end-to-end **Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system designed to answer complex queries on female athlete physiology, relative energy deficiency in sport (RED-S), iron metabolism, menstrual cycle phase nutritional adjustments, and ISSN consensus guidelines.

Unlike standard RAG pipelines, Athletica acts as an autonomous agent that can iteratively search through curated peer-reviewed literature and execute mathematical physiological calculators to provide accurate, hallucination-free guidance backed by precise **PMID citations**.

## 🚀 How to reproduce (local deployment)

To run the full Athletica pipeline on your local machine:

### 1. Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.10+
- An OpenAI API Key (Configure it in a `.env` file at the root of the project: `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here`)

### 2. Start the vector database
We use Elasticsearch to store and retrieve the embedded scientific chunks. Start it via Docker:
```bash
docker start elasticsearch || docker run -d --name elasticsearch -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e "discovery.type=single-node" -e "xpack.security.enabled=false" docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.4.3
```

### 3. Setup virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Or use uv sync
```

### 4. Index the data (optional)
The dataset is already parsed into `data/processed/optimizations/optimization_3/chunks.json`. 
Run the retrieval script once to index these chunks into Elasticsearch:
```bash
python evaluate_retrieval.py
```

### 5. Launch the Streamlit app
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Open `http://localhost:8501` in your browser.

## 📈 Development journey & optimizations

Building Athletica was an iterative process focused on maximizing scientific accuracy and eliminating hallucinations. Below is a summary of the optimizations and evaluations performed:

### 1. Section-aware chunking (optimization 3)
Arbitrary character splitting destroys scientific context. We built a custom parser to split the PDFs respecting logical boundaries (*Abstract, Methods, Discussion*) and filtering out bibliographic noise.
- **Result:** Improved Baseline BM25 Hit Rate@15 from 29% to **43%**.

### 2. Dense vector retrieval (optimization 4)
BM25 struggled with colloquial synonyms (e.g., "pill" vs "oral contraceptives"). We introduced `sentence-transformers` (MiniLM-L6) to generate 384-dimensional dense vectors and used Elasticsearch KNN.
- **Result:** Hit Rate@5 reached **31.7%** (MRR: 0.209). We also tested Cross-Encoder reranking which pushed Hit Rate@5 to **40.7%**.

### 3. LLM-as-a-judge evaluation
We generated a synthetic "Ground Truth" dataset of 600 QA pairs acting as an "expert sports scientist". Using strict Pydantic schemas, we evaluated our generation pipeline on a random sample of 50 questions:
- **Faithfulness:** **100%**. Our strict prompt successfully forced the LLM to abstain ("I don't know") rather than hallucinate when the retriever failed.
- **Relevance:** **50%**. Because the LLM couldn't hallucinate, relevance dropped to 0% whenever the pure vector search missed the exact chunk on the first try.

### 4. Agentic RAG loop (optimization 5)
To fix the 50% relevance bottleneck, we upgraded from a "One-Shot" RAG to an **Agentic RAG**. We provided the LLM with `search_medical_literature` as a callable tool inside a `while` loop. 
- **Result:** The agent now reasons about its initial search results. If the retrieved chunks are irrelevant, it automatically triggers a second or third search with different keywords before answering. This drastically improved perceived relevance and user experience. We also added two custom mathematical tools (`calculate_energy_availability` and `issn_dosage_safety_checker`) to extend the agent's capabilities beyond mere text retrieval.

## 🎯 Getting started: 5 prompts to try

Once the app is running, copy and paste these prompts sequentially to see the Agent's reasoning engine in action. Check the **🤖 Agent Stats** box in the UI to see how many tools and iterations it used!

**1. Conversational (zero-shot)**
> "Hello, who are you and what can you help me with?"
*(Expect 1 Iteration, 0 tools used. Fast response.)*

**2. Standard medical search**
> "What are the effects of the menstrual cycle on endurance running?"
*(Expect the agent to invoke the `search_medical_literature` tool to retrieve accurate evidence.)*

**3. Tool: ISSN dosage safety checker**
> "I weigh 55kg and I want to start loading creatine. Is it safe to take 15g today?"
*(Expect the agent to use the `issn_dosage_safety_checker` tool to mathematically verify the dose against your bodyweight).*

**4. Tool: RED-S calculator (energy availability)**
> "I weigh 60kg and have 18% body fat. My daily intake is 2200 kcal and I burn 800 kcal exercising on the track. Am I at risk of RED-S?"
*(Expect the agent to invoke the `calculate_energy_availability` tool to calculate your FFM and EA).*

**5. Parallel execution (search + tools)**
> "I'm feeling very fatigued. I weigh 58kg and I'm thinking of taking 200mg of iron at once. What does the literature recommend for fatigue, and is this dose safe according to ISSN?"
*(Expect the agent to invoke BOTH the medical search and the ISSN calculator simultaneously in the same turn).*
